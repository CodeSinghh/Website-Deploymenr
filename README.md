# Details About Project
This is my first project in Cloud Computing, and the project I choose to start with is __Deploying a basic (static) website__. And the cloud platform that is choose is AWS, and I prefer AWS for several reasons
1. AWS has Wide Variety of service
2. Simple & Easy language Documenations for Quick help
3. I have hands-on experience in many of the services

This project is a basic-level project that will provide you with an idea and knowledge of how to deploy a static website using various AWS services. Throughout this project, I encountered many problems and irritating issues that seemed unsolvable. However, after overcoming these challenges, I successfully completed the project. I have documented each step and provided different approaches in my documentation. Additionally, I created another documentation detailing the problems I faced as a beginner. Please check it out for a comprehensive A to Z overview of this project.
